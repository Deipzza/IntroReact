# IntroReact
In this repository I'll be adding the programs, apps, scripts and other stuff I
use while studying React.

Currently I'm learning from [this Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvq-jIkSeTUZ5XcUw8fJPTBKEHEKPMTKk).
This can be seen on the folder *react-basico*, where I'm adding the scripts for components and hooks used in each video.
